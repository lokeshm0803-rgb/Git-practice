this is my first git interaction !

Git and Git hub 

staging --- add

commit means taking snapshot of our contents

git log shows our previous commits data 

git branch are different pointers to contents at particular time

git branch <>

git checkout <> --will go to branch <>

git branch -- shows all branches
